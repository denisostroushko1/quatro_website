My current work focuses on using game engines as GIS to visualize large-scale landscapes with a focus on forested systems as a method for scientific communication and outreach. Past projects have focused on landscape and community ecology, and have included predictive models of forest biomass from remote sensing data and the landscape-level impacts of beaver within New York’s Adirondack State Park. In all of these projects I’ve worked to apply data science techniques to large-scale challenges, frequently serving as the statistical and technical expert within my team."
